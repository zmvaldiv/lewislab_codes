# lewislab_codes
This repository was create July 2019 and contains all of the codes I've personally worked on while working at the Lewis Lab.

Most codes use the functions in the general_code folder. 
For the sleep_scoring folder, these functions are needed:
occ_chan_per_subj.m
framewisedisplacement.m
plotclicktimes.m
sleep_scor_chan.m
mtspecgramc_detrend_laura.m
      
For the bcg_project folder, these functions are needed:
loadchan.m
ecgcomboplot.m
